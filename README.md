# Data Forms

DataForms allows you to create physical manifestations of data. Data sets are drawn on a 2D plane and downloadable as a single SVG. Modify the downloaded file or send it straight to a laser cutter for processing.

Visit [dataforms.joelongstreet.com](https://dataforms.joelongstreet.com) to use the app.
